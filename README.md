## About the Workshop 
How do we remove bias from the machine learning models and ensure that the predictions are fair? What are the three stages in which the bias mitigation solution can be applied? This code pattern answers these questions and more to help developers, data scientists, stakeholders take informed decision by consuming the results of predictive models.

Fairness in data, and machine learning algorithms is critical to building safe and responsible AI systems from the ground up by design. Both technical and business AI stakeholders are in constant pursuit of fairness to ensure they meaningfully address problems like AI bias. While accuracy is one metric for evaluating the accuracy of a machine learning model, fairness gives us a way to understand the practical implications of deploying the model in a real-world situation.

## How does the fairness algorithm work?

The bias mitigation algorithm can be applied in three different stages of model building. These stages are pre-processing, in-processing & post-processing. The below diagram demonstrates how it works.
![algorithm-working](https://github.com/Anam-Mahmood/AIEthics/blob/main/images/aif-360-flow.png?raw=true)

The AIF360 Python package contains nine different algorithms, developed by the broader algorithmic fairness research community, to mitigate that unwanted bias. They can all be called in a standard way, very similar to scikit-learnâ€™s fit/predict paradigm. In this way, we hope that the package is not only a way to bring all of us researchers together, but also a way to translate our collective research results to data scientists, data engineers, and developers deploying solutions in a variety of industries. You can learn more about AIF 360 here.

## Step 4: Add Data

Go to https://github.com/Anam-Mahmood/AI-Ethics and either clone or download code in zip file. Un-zip the folder.

Now that you have the code files on your computer, go to your AutoAI project on IBM Cloud.
Click on Assets and select Browse and add fraud_data.csv file from your file system. Repeat the step and add the Pipeline_LabelEncoder-0.1.zip file as an asset.

## Step 5: Create the notebook


### Note: You will create three Notebooks here by repeating the below steps. 

From IBM Watson Dashboard click on "Add to project" and select "Notebook"

## Step 7: Run the notebook & Analyze Result

Click on Run icon to run the code

<img width="576" alt="16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16270682/130236006-504d58d2-ff57-4403-a2a5-b584b9aa5d4d.PNG">

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag format is In [x]:. Depending on the state of the notebook, the x can be:

    A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
    A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
    A *, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

    One cell at a time.
        Select the cell, and then press the Play button in the toolbar.
    Batch mode, in sequential order.
        From the Cell menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you can Run All cells in your notebook, or you can Run All Below, that will start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then continue executing all cells that follow.
        
        
After we run all cells in the notebook, the results are displayed at the end of each notebook per below.
Pre-processing results We can observe that, priviledged group had 37% more chance of getting a favorable outcome because of the bias in the dataset.
